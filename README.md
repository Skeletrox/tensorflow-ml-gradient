# Tensorflow Basics

## Basic Gates

An excellent starting point for those wishing to jump into ML and DL. Here I represent basic gates using a neural network.

## Regression

Linear and quadratic regression.

## Classification

A binary and a one-vs-all multiclass classifier

## Seq 2 Seq Network

A basic Seq 2 Seq Network that <i>attempts</i> to predict future values. Currently works for regression. Closely follows <a href='https://github.com/guillaume-chevalier/seq2seq-signal-prediction'>this project</a>.
